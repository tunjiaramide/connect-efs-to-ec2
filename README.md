# Set up NFS Server on EC2 Servers

In this archictecture, we will set up two EC2 instances in two different AZs, and make them share same data from a single NFS server. We will be using Amazon Linux 2

### Create an IAM Role
Create an EC2 Role and attach the AmazonElasticFileSystemClientFullAccess policy

### Create a SG
Create an SG, add inbound rules
Add NFS with TCP 2049, select public in source
Add SSH with TCP 22, select public in source

### Launch the EFS Server

Move to EFS dashboard to create one.

We will be using default VPC, choose a name and select customize

For testing purpose, we disable automatic backups, choose bursting in performance settings and disable encryption and choose next

Remove all available zones not in use, just use 1a and 1b, then remove the default security group, and add the SG created earlier

Click next and click create

Wait till has fully provisioned, under EFS created, check Network tab to make sure Mount target state has finished creating

### Launch EC2 instance

Launch an EC2 instance, name it Web_server_one, choose Amazon Linux 2

Select the subnet us-east-1a

Select SG created earlier

Attach the IAM role created earlier and click create

Launch another EC2 instance, name it Web_server_two and select subnet us-east-1b,

Follow same steps to create the second instance

### Configure NFS Server on Web server one

Go into Web_server_one and connect using EC2 instance connect

Run the following commands below: 

sudo mkdir -p /efs/content

sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils 

sudo nano /etc/fstab 

nfs-server-id:/ /efs/content efs _netdev,tls,iam 0 0  

sudo mount /efs/content

df -k

cd /efs/content

sudo touch testfile.txt 

### Configure NFS Server on Web server two and view the file created

sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils

sudo mkdir -p /efs/content

sudo nano /etc/fstab

nfs-server-id:/ /efs/content efs _netdev,tls,iam 0 0 

sudo mount /efs/content

cd /efs/content

ls -la

Check to see if you see testfile.txt is available
